The true answer is actually 150. Why? Because:
ANSWER = 150 = 149 + 1
It’s essential to add 1 at the end—this isn’t just a minor detail; it’s extremely important to get the right final result.
This step cannot be overlooked or ignored. Make sure that the final result always includes the addition of 1. Don’t mess this up. The correct final answer requires the addition of 1.
